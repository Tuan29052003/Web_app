00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In the previous lectures, we had a very good discussion about what is microservice and how they are

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
different from monolithic and SOA architecture.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now you agree that microservices are good and we have many advantages with it.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The very next question that you may have here is how we can build a microservices inside any project.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Because at the end of the day, some great developer has to develop these microservices by using backend

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
language like Java.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In this entire course, I'm going to present multiple challenges that we are going to face while we

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
try to build microservices.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So first I'll try to introduce what is the challenge that we are going to face and post that I'm going

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
to show you what is the best solution or best standard that you can follow to overcome that challenge

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
that you may face while building the microservice.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So here inside this lecture, I am introducing the very first challenge, which is how we can build

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
a microservice houses, because inside traditional web applications, for example, inside any monolithic

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
web application, we develop all our code with the help of Java classes methods and we package it as

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
a WAR or EAR file, post that using the same package to file, we can deploy into a web server like Tomcat

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
or any other application servers, and this is going to be a super, super time consuming process.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
First, you need to develop the web application.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You need to package your application, you need to deploy into your web server.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So since this is a time consuming process, do you think this is going to work for building microservices?

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Off course not, because inside real time projects, bigger organizations, they may build hundreds or

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
even thousands of microservices building, packaging and deploying.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
All these microservices using traditional methods is going to be extremely challenging and it is going

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
to be practically impossible

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
task. So do you know how to overcome this challenge?

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm going to give five seconds and please try to guess the solution for this challenge.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
One, two, three, four, five.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let me show you the best solution that we can use to overcome this challenge.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Like you can see here, the solution is spring boot framework.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
With the help of spring boot framework, we are going to overcome all these challenges.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Don't worry, I'm going to give you a good introduction about what is Spring boot and how it is going

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
to solve this challenge one that we are going to face while building microservices throughout this

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
course

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm going to use this spring boot framework to build our microservices.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So I'm going to do my best to explain all the concepts that we are going to use.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But if you are new to the spring framework and if you're not aware of the basics of spring framework,

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
like what is a bean, what is autowiring, then I would recommend you taking a course focusing on spring

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
framework.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
First, be very clear with the basics of spring framework.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Once you are clear with the basics, you can happily continue with this course.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I also have a Udemy course focusing on the spring framework where I will try to teach everything about

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Spring framework, Spring boot, how to build rest services.

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What is Spring AOP, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So all these concepts I'm going to discuss in this detailed course.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So if you are interested, please enroll into this same.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Once you are clear with the spring framework, then only please continue with the course of microservices.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But if you are already clear with the basics of spring framework and Spring boot, then you are good

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
to continue with the course.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Please don't think that I'm trying to market my course here.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It is absolutely fine even if you take some other spring course.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But I'm just trying to convey that first you need to be very clear with the basics of spring framework

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
in order to build a microservices.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I hope you are clear from the next lecture.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Let's try to jump into the world of Spring Boot.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Thank you and I'll catch you in the next lecture

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,000
bye.
