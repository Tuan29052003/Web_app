00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Inside this lecture,

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
let me show you a few funny memes about spring boot framework.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That way we are taking a small break of one minute.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So are you ready for the funny memes?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So this is the very first funny meme about the spring boot framework.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So some Java developer who don't know about Spring Boot is trying to say the Batman, that Java development

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
is very hard.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You can see the response from Batman is he slap him and he saying go and use spring boot because spring

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
boot framework is going to make Java developer life super, super easy.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Are you ready for the next meme?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So this is the next meme.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So if you see we have two big frameworks sitting in the Java ecosystem.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
One is spring framework and the other one is spring boot framework, which built on top of spring framework.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And if you try to compare with any other Java framework like Struts, EJB, Servlets, So there are

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
many technologies and frameworks available in Java to make developer life easy.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But the clear winner is spring and spring boot frameworks.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let's go to the next meme.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So here you can see some experienced Java developer is saying, please see the Java world everywhere.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We have Spring Boot.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So whatever Java web application that you see inside any organization, there is a very, very good

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
chance that they might be using spring boot framework.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I can confidently say 90% of Java projects they use either spring or spring boot framework inside their

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
projects.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Moving on to the next meme.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So here you can see some Java developer who are trying to give two options.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You want to go with the spring framework or spring boot framework.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Like I said before, spring framework is a very good framework, but make developer life easy and to

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
increase the developer productivity.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We have another framework built on top of spring framework, which is spring boot.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's why any Java developer loves to use spring boot framework in their day to day development.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Moving on to the next meme.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So someone asking Iron Man, when did you become an expert on Spring boot and rest services?

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So the response from him is last night.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So this meme clearly conveys that learning Spring boot and building microservices are rest services

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
with the help of Spring Boot is not a big challenge.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Spending few hours, you can become a master of spring boot and you can start building web applications,

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
rest services and microservices.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You will also realize that inside this course, just by spending few hours, we are going to build a

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
microservices.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I hope you are clear.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The next meme that we have here is, someone is trying to directly learn the spring boot framework.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So though it is technically possible for you to learn spring boot without knowing the spring core concept,

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
but you are going to struggle a lot in the long run.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So if you are not clear about the spring and spring core concepts like what is dependency injection,

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
inversion of control, autowiring, how to create beans, What is spring MVC?

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I would request you to first learn the basics of the spring framework, then only try to master the

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
spring boot framework. That is the ideal path and having the foundation basics strong always will help

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
you to debug any issues that you are going to face inside your real time projects.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And the next image is not a funny image.

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's just an image indicating the power of spring boot framework.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Like you can see by looking at the iceberg, we always look at the tip of the iceberg from outside,

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
but below we never know how strong it is and what are the other factors and dependencies making that

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
iceberg very strong.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So if you see here, spring boot is always tip of the iceberg, but there are many other dependencies

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and components and frameworks and technologies that you need to learn as a Java software engineer.

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So with the help of Spring Boot, Spring security, Docker, microservices, a cloud environment like

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
AWS, persistent framework like JPA, Hibernate and message queues like Rabbitmq, Kafka.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So with all these technologies, you are going to become a complete Java developer and Spring Boot has

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
the integration with all these components that you are seeing on the screen.

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I hope you are clear and you have some fun

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
break in between these course.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Thank you and I'll catch you in the next lecture bye.
