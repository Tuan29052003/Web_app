1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the previous lecture, we decided to create a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud with the help of Google

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Cloud.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
To get started on the same first, we need to visit cloud.google.com.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And here inside this website you can log in with your Gmail account. If you are logged in to this website

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
very first time, it is going to offer you $300 free credit that you can use within 90 days.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But if you have already used a Gmail account previously inside this website, I would recommend creating

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
a new Gmail account and log in again into this website so that you will be eligible to get a $300 free

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
credit.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I already logged in into this website using a gmail and since I'm a new user into this website with

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
my gmail, it is offering me to take the $300 free credit and explore more than 20 plus products with

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
this free credit.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So if you click on this banner, you will be taken to a website where you can see all the details about

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
your free credit.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
If you can scroll down on this page, under this free tier products, you will be able to see a product

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
with the name Google Kubernetes Engine.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So this is the same product that we want to use to create a Kubernetes cluster inside the Google Cloud.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And since this is eligible under the free tier, I can use that $300 free credit that I'm going to get

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
whenever I create a new account.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So this is the main reason or a primary reason on why I choose Google Cloud compared to AWS and Azure.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I hope you are clear.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Let me close this tab.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Post that once you logged in into this website, you can click on this console button and if you are

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
landing on to this console page, very first time, it is going to offer you $300 free trial that you

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
need to use within 90 days.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You can click on this, try for free.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And with that it will ask you all your personal details to which country you belong and what best describes

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
about me.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Here

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm going to select business idea slash startup idea was that I can select this checkbox under the terms

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
of services and click on this continue button.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Before that, you can also see here Google Cloud is going to give $300 in credit spend over the next

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
90 days and they are also assuring no auto charge after free trial ends.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Once you read all this information, you can click on this continue button.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Inside this page,

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
it is going to ask your credit card details.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
All the cloud providers, they will ask your credit card details because after the free credit, if

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
you start using the other products, like creating a database or creating a server or creating a Kubernetes

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
cluster, they want you to charge.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's why please, please make sure you are not creating unnecessary products inside the cloud and

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
always be cautious on what you create whenever you are done exploring about a product, please make

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
sure you are deleting the product so that you are not spending your $300 free credit within 1 or 2 days.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
For some reason, if you are not comfortable providing your credit card details, please don't provide

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,000
them.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You can always see the steps that I'm following at the process that I'm following to understand the

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
steps that we need to follow to deploy our microservices into the cloud

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
kubernetes cluster.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Behind the scenes, I'm going to enter all my credit card details once the credit card details are entered

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and validated by the Google Cloud, you can click on this button, which is Start my free trial.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Once you enter your credit card details

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and the same is validated by the Google Cloud, it is going to show you a message something like this,

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
setting up your billing and in the down

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
also you should be able to see a confirmation saying that setting up your free trial.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So please give some time for this to complete.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
After a few seconds you will be landed onto the Google Cloud Console homepage.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
If not, you can visit the console.cloud.google.com.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And this is how it is going to look like.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
By the time you logged in onto this page, the Google Cloud by default is going to create a project

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
with the name my first project, and this is the ID of your project.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Using this project, you can explore all the products with the help of $300 free credits.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So to get started around this, so now I can create a Kubernetes cluster inside the Google Cloud.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But before that we need to make sure we install the cloud SDK inside our local system.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Why should I install the Google Cloud SDK?

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Because when we install this cloud SDK inside our local system, from our local system itself, we can

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
connect with the Kubernetes cluster that is created inside the Google Cloud and from our local system

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
itself

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
we can give some commands or we can also install our helm charts from our local system.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So to communicate with the products available inside the Google Cloud from your local system, we need

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
to make sure we install this cloud SDK.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So please visit this website, which is cloud.google.com/sdk.

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
On this page you can click on this, Get started in this page you will be having all the steps that

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
you need to

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
followed to install the Google Cloud CLI.

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So before we try to begin, we need to make sure we completed these two steps.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
One is creating a Google Cloud project which we already created previously because as of now I'm able

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
to see my project, which is my first project.

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
After that, we should also make sure the building is enabled for our Google Cloud project.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We did that in the previous steps by providing a credit card details.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If you can scroll down on this page based upon your operating system, you will be having the list of

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
steps that you need to follow to install the Google Cloud cli.

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So please make sure you are following these steps based upon your operating system.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Since I'm using Mac OS, I already followed all these steps and installed the Google cloud CLI inside

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
my local system. So to confirm if your installation is successful or not, you can run a command which

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
is gcloud - -version.

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So you can run this command inside your terminal from any location.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If the installation is successful, you're going to get an output

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
something like this.

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And once you validate the installation, you need to run a command which is gcloud init. Using this gcloud

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,000
init,

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,000
we are going to login into our Google cloud account from our local system with the help of Google Cloud.

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So let me run this command.

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This will give some options to me.

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I will go with the third option, which is it is going to reinitialize my existing configuration with

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
the name default.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So let me choose this third option and post that it is going to perform some network connection.

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Once the network connection is successful, it is going to ask you whether I want to log in into my

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Google Cloud account.

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So here, please make sure you are giving the answer as Y, which means yes and post that it will open

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
your browser where you need to select your gmail account using which you want to log in into the Google

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
cloud.

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So I'm selecting the Gmail account.

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
After you select your Gmail account, it will also ask you for your permission whether I want to provide

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
some privileges to the Google Cloud SDK to access my Google account details.

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So I am going to click on this allow button and with that you will see this page which is your now authenticated

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
with the Google Cloud CLI.

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You can also confirm inside the terminal.

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Inside the terminal you can see I got an output saying that pick one of the Google cloud project to

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,000
use.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So the project that just now we created is liquid-muse-397814.

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So that's why I'm going to give the input as one and post that I'll press enter and with that you will

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
get an output saying that your Google Cloud SDK is configured and ready to use.

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It will also show you the email account and the project that you are connected with the help of Google

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Cloud SDK.

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I hope you are clear on how to set up a free account inside the Google Cloud and how to connect to the

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
same with the help of Google Cloud CLI.

115
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
As a next step, we can start creating a Kubernetes cluster inside the Google Cloud.

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Thank you and I'll catch you in the next lecture bye.
