00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Are you excited to create a Kubernetes cluster inside Google Cloud?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm very excited to show you the steps that you need to follow to create the Kubernetes cluster.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Don't worry, it is not going to be super complex.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It is a very, very simple task to create a Kubernetes cluster inside any of the cloud environment.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So to create a Kubernetes cluster, you can either click on this option, which is a create a GKE cluster,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
or you can search for Kubernetes in the search box and you will have an option, which is Kubernetes

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
engine.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So please click on the Kubernetes engine option since you are trying to access this Kubernetes engine

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
very first time inside your account, it is going to ask you to enable the Kubernetes Engine API.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So please click on this Enable option.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And as soon as you enable the Kubernetes Engine API, it is asking you to enable the building so you

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
can click on this enable billing option.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
As soon as you click on the Enable option, then you will be landed on to the Kubernetes engine page.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Here you have an option to create a Kubernetes cluster.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Please click on the same.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
By default

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
it is going to show you an option to create an auto pilot cluster.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Auto pilot cluster is a flavor of Kubernetes cluster provided by the Google Cloud to make our life easy.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So based upon our traffic, the cluster capacity will be automatically adjusted by the Google Cloud.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But if you go with this option, we will not be able to explore much about the Kubernetes cluster because

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
the heavy lifting is going to be done by the Google Cloud.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And this is the easiest option that any organization they can follow to set up the Kubernetes cluster.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But inside this course, since we want to explore more about the Kubernetes cluster inside the Google

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Cloud, we need to make sure we are clicking on this switch to Standard Cluster.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So let me click on this and it is going to ask you for confirmation one more time.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So let me click on this switch to Standard Cluster.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Now here I need to give a name to my cluster so I'm fine with this name, which is cluster-1.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We should be fine with all the default values.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We can straight away come towards the end and click on this create button.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But before that, here you can see estimated monthly cost.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
If you try to run this cluster continuously for one month, you are going to be charged $176.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That means $0.24 per hour.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But don't worry, we are not going to take much time.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Within an hour we are going to close the discussion.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
On top of that, you also have free credits.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You should not be charged anything if you follow my instructions.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Now I'm good with all these default settings.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Let me click on this create button.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
As soon as I click on the Create button, The Kubernetes cluster creation process will get started with

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
a default capacity of three nodes.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So it is going to be created at this location.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So this is going to take at least five minutes time.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So please wait for five minutes for your Kubernetes cluster to get created successfully.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I hope you are clear with the steps that we followed to create a Kubernetes cluster inside Google Cloud.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
From the next lecture, let's try to explore more details about these Kubernetes cluster and how to

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
deploy our microservices into this Kubernetes cluster.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Thank you, and I'll catch you in the next lecture bye.
