1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
As of now, we deployed all our microservices into a local Kubernetes cluster.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Inside this section, we are going to learn on how to deploy our microservices into a Kubernetes cluster

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that we have created in one of the cloud provider.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Kubernetes is so modular and flexible and extensible that it can be deployed on on premises or in a

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
third party data center or in any of the cloud providers.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And if needed, you can create an Kubernetes cluster across multiple cloud providers as well.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But usually creating and maintaining a Kubernetes cluster can be very challenging, especially in on

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
premises.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's why many enterprise organizations, they look for the cloud providers, which will make their

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
job easier to maintain their microservices architecture using Kubernetes cluster.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you are going to work on any real time project who are trying to deploy their microservices into

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
a Kubernetes cluster, then there is a very good chance that your organization may use any of the cloud

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
providers that I have highlighted in the slide.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Like, you know, we have three famous cloud providers from Amazon we have AWS, from Google we have GCP,

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
from Microsoft we have Azure.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So all these cloud providers, they provide Kubernetes capabilities with different, different names.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For example, inside GCP, we call the Kubernetes product as GKE, which means Google Kubernetes engine.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Similarly inside the AWS, we call it as EKS, which means elastic Kubernetes service.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And at last, inside Azure, the Kubernetes product is called as AKS, which means Azure Kubernetes

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,000
service.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Inside this course, I'm going to show you on how to deploy our applications into the Kubernetes cluster

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
that we are going to create inside the GCP, which is Google Cloud provider.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The reason why I choose GCP compared to AWS and Azure is, inside GCP,

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
when you try to create a new account, they are going to give you a $300 free credit using which you

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
can explore many of the products provided by the GCP. Off course, AWS, Azure, they also provide some

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
free credit, but inside the GCP only with the help of free credits or free tier, we can create a Kubernetes

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
cluster.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Whereas with AWS and Azure, we need to pay some money to create the Kubernetes cluster, even though

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
we are a new user.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
With that reason, I'm going to create a Kubernetes cluster inside GCP.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I hope this is also going to be helpful for you because without putting your own money, you can try

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
to create Kubernetes cluster inside cloud and deploy your microservices into the GCP provided Kubernetes

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
cluster.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I hope you are clear with the agenda of this session.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Thank you and I'll catch you in the next lecture bye.
