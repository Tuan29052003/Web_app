1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We decided to build event driven microservices wherever possible inside our microservice network.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In order to build event driven microservices inside the industry

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
there are two majorly used event driven models available.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The very first one is, publisher subscriber model.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In short form, we can also call it as pub/sub model.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This model revolves around subscriptions.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
P roducers they will generate the events and that are distributed to all the interested subscribers for consumption.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Inside this model,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
once an event is received and consumed by the consumers, it cannot be replayed again and again, which

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
means any new subscribers joining later will not have access to the past events.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Very similar to this pub/sub model,

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
we also have event streaming model. Inside this model

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
also the producers will be produce the events and the consumers will consume the events.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But there is a clear difference between these two models.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So let's try to understand what is this difference. Inside event streaming model events will be written

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
into a log in a sequential manner.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Producers publish the events as they occur and these events are stored in a well ordered fashion.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Now coming to the consumers instead of subscribing to the events, the consumers, they will have the

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
ability to read from any part of the event stream, which means the events can be replayed, allowing

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
the clients to join at any time and receive all the past events as well.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So this is one of the major difference and you need to choose one of them based upon your business scenario.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If your business scenario is not expecting your consumers to read the past events, then pub pubsub

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
is a ideal model.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Whereas if you want to give flexibility to your consumers or subscribers to read the past events or

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
to replay the past events also, then definitely in such scenarios you need to choose event streaming

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
model. If needed

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
inside event streaming model we can disable the replaying of the events feature, so there is no good

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
or bad inside these two approaches.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Please choose based upon your business scenarios.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Now these are the two models but you may have a question like how can I follow these models or how

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
can I implement these models inside my microservices. For the same both of these models, they have various

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
products available.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If you see here, the pub/sub model is frequently implemented with the Rabbitmq.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So this is a very popular option.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
On the other hand, Apache Kafka is a robust platform widely utilized for event streaming processing.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Inside this course

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
also, we are going to leverage these products since these are two different products, completely different

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
from each other, providing various capabilities.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm going to completely discuss them in two different sections. Inside this section

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
first, we are going to focus on building event driven microservices with the help of Rabbitmq.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Whereas in the next section we are going to focus on building event driven microservices with the help

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
of Apache Kafka.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I hope you are clear with these two event driven models.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
From the next lecture we can try to explore the pub/sub model with the help of Rabbitmq.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Thank you and I'll catch you in the next lecture bye.
