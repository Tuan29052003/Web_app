1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
To get started with the Apache Kafka inside our microservices.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
First, we need to make sure we set up the Apache Kafka inside our local system.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
For the same, you can come to this official website of Kafka, which is Kafka.apache.org.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So here you'll be able to see a quick introduction about what is Kafka, what are its core capabilities,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
what are its use cases ?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
If you are interested, please read them.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But I just wanted to highlight here you can see the statement, which is more than 80% of the fortune

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
100 companies they trust and use Kafka.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And apart from this statement, you should also see some more metrics here, like ten out of ten manufacturing

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
companies, they are using Kafka, seven out of ten banks, ten out of ten insurance companies, and

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
eight out of ten telecom companies,

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
they are using Kafka. Because all the organizations that come under these domains, they produce a lot

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,000
of data.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So they need something which is capable of processing a lot of data asynchronously or with the event

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
streaming.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That's why they are using Apache Kafka. With this,

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm assuming it also gives a confidence to you that Apache Kafka is a better product compared to the

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Rabbitmq.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So to get started with the local setup of Apache Kafka, you can click on this get started and there

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
is an option Quick start.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So let me click on that.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So since I'm using the Mac OS, I have the steps that I can follow inside my Mac system.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
If you are using Windows operating system, you may need to use corresponding commands to set up the

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Kafka inside your local system.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So first there is a download link.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I can click on that to download the Apache Kafka.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
From this website I can click very first link that I have which will download my Apache Kafka into my

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
local system.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So you can see the download is right now happening.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Let's wait for this to complete.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Meanwhile, let's try to understand what are the commands that I need to run.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The very first command is to extract the compressed file that it is going to download.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
After the extraction of the file is completed, I need to go inside the folder with the name provided

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
here.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So once my terminal is inside my Kafka folder, I can follow the steps that they have provided here

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
to start the Kafka environment.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Here they have provided two approaches Kafka with Zookeeper and Kafka with KRaft.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So Kafka with a KRaft is a newer approach because they are trying to get rid of Zookeeper, which is

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
a extra component that we need to set up whenever we want to set up a Kafka cluster inside the local

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
system.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Since the approach with Zookeeper is going to be retired someday, I'm going to use the newer approach,

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
which is Kafka with the KRaft.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So now my download is completed.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Let me go to my terminal.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I open my terminal at the downloads location.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
If you can try to run the pwd, you can see right now I'm at the downloads folder location.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Now I'm going to run this very first command to extract the compressed downloaded file.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So let me copy this command and mention the same inside my terminal and run the same.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So the extraction process is completed.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
As a next step, I can go inside my Kafka folder, so let me run this cd command.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Now I can try to run the commands that they have provided inside the website.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Inside this page,

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
if you can scroll down to the steps that they have mentioned under the Kafka with the KRaft section.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
First, I need to run this command, which is I want to generate a random cluster ID and assign the

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
same to my Kafka cluster.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So let me run this first command.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Once the first command is completed, try to run the second command.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So this is the second command.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Let me copy this entire command.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll go to my terminal and here I'm going to run the same. Once the second command is also completed.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Finally, we can run the third command to run the Kafka server.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So this is the third command.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let me try to copy the same and mention the same here and execute it. With this you can see my Kafka

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
started at the port 9092.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So this is the place where my Kafka broker is going to be available.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So with this now, we have successfully set up the Kafka inside the local system.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
In the next lecture, let's try to update our accounts and message microservices code to connect to

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
this Kafka and leverage Kafka for event streaming and asynchronous communication.

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Thank you.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And I'll catch you in the next lecture bye.
