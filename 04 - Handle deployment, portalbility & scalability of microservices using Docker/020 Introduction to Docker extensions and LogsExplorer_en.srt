00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Inside this lecture, let me introduce a Docker extension that may be useful for you on day to day basis.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You can see inside your Docker desktop there is an option add extensions.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
There are thousands of Docker extensions available which you can use based upon your requirements on

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
day to day basis.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So whenever you are into a problem while using Docker containers, Docker images or Docker desktop,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
always search for if there is any extension that will solve your problem.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
By installing these extensions, you can make your life easy.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
One such extension is related to logs, so if you search for log, there is an extension with the name

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Logs Explorer.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You can see if you can click on this.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This is officially published by the Docker company itself.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You can click on this install button as soon as you click on this install button, this extension will

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
be installed inside your Docker desktop.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So let me close this right now.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You can see the installation is completed.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
With that, I have a logs explorer under my extensions, so let me click on that.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You can see there is no logs information right now because I have installed this just now.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So with the help of these Logs Explorer, we can see all the logs of our running containers or stopped

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
containers.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So let me show you a demo of this extension. For the same,

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm going to run a command which is docker compose up, which will start all of my containers.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Now I can go to my Docker desktop.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Here you can see under accounts there are three different microservices are running like loans microservice,

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
cards microservice and accounts microservice.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And each microservice has its own color.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Like all accounts microservice related logs are highlighted in a blue color.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Similarly for loan, it is red color, and for cards it is green color.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So you can look for all the logs from this Logs Explorer itself instead of navigating each of the container.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If you are looking for the logs of a specific container, you can select here and that will do the filtration

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
automatically and you will be able to see only the logs related to the loans microservice.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And at the same time there is also a filter option to see the running containers logs or the stopped

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
container logs.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
There is also a search button and if you want to see the logs based upon the specific log type like

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
standard output or standard error, you can select the option accordingly.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This way, these Docker extensions are going to make our lives super, super easy and Logs Explorer

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
is one such extension.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I would strongly recommend you to install this extension inside your system as well. In future

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
anytime

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
like I said, if you face any problem with the Docker or if there is some task which is taking you a

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
lot of time, then look for extensions because somebody might have faced the same issue and they might

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
have built the extension, which which is right now available for others to use.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So with the help of these extensions, make your life easy.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's what my recommendation here.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Thank you,

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and I'll catch you in the next lecture bye.
