00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In the previous lecture, we explored the commands of docker Compose, which is docker compose up,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and similarly docker compose down.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We saw that with the help of docker compose up, we will be able to create the containers.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So whenever we use this docker compose up command, it is going to create your containers from scratch.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If you see here right now there are three containers created from scratch because I have used docker

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,000
compose up command. Now using docker compose down command, I can stop and I can also remove the containers.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Think like there is a scenario where I don't want to remove my containers, but simply I want to stop

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
them.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
In such scenario you can use docker compose space, stop.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This will stop all the running containers that you have started

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
with the help of docker compose command.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You can also see right now the containers are simply stopped.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If I want to start them again, the command that I need to use is docker compose start.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So there is a clear difference between start and up Command.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Start Command will look for the existing containers and it will try to start them again.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So that is what happening here.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Like you can see right now, they are in the running status.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Now,

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
this time I'm going to use docker compose down, which will stop and remove my containers.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So now you can see all of my containers are removed.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We confirm the same inside my Docker desktop.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now if I try to execute a command which is docker compose start since there are no containers, it will

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
simply fail with a reason.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
There is no service with the name cards are similarly, there is no service with the name, loans and

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
accounts.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And even if you try to run a command stop without any running containers, there will be no effect due

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,000
to this command.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Now let me try to run the command docker

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
compose up again with a -d. So this will create the containers from scratch and start the same.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
After starting

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm going to simply stop them with the command docker compose stop and this will stop all the running

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,000
containers

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
like you can see.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
My containers are not deleted.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
They are only being stopped. In this scenario,

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
if I try to run the command which is docker compose up, it is not going to create the containers from

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,000
scratch.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Instead, it is going to leverage the existing containers already with the same names like cards-ms

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and accounts microservice and loans microservice.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So that is what's happening here.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I hope you are getting a complete picture of docker

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
compose up, docker compose down, docker compose start and docker compose stop.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So there is a clear difference between these commands, so please make sure you are clear and use them

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
accordingly on your day to day basis.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Most of the times I'm going to use docker compose up and docker compose down because I always make

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
sure I'm deleting my containers when I don't need them.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That will give me some space inside my local system.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I hope this is clear to you.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Thank you and I'll catch you in the next lecture bye.
