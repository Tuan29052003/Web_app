1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now is the time to install Docker inside your local system.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I already installed Docker inside my local system long back.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's why I'm not going to install again inside my system.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But I'll show you the steps that you need to follow to install the docker inside your system.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
These steps are going to be pretty straightforward and pretty easy, so please do follow these steps

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and make sure you are installing the docker inside your system.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Without installing Docker.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You cannot practice all the microservice concepts that we are going to discuss from now onwards.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If you have intentions to practice along with me, please make sure you are installing the Docker inside

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
your system.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Like you can see here.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
First we need to visit docker.com.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is the website.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Inside this website.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
As soon as you land on this homepage, you have an option to download the Docker desktop.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Since mine is a mac operating system, it is automatically detecting that and it is asking me to download

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
the Mac related Docker desktop.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Based upon your operating system, you can select any of the operating systems available like Apple,

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Windows and Linux.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So once you select, you can click on this download Docker desktop option and post that it is going

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
to be simple.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You just have to double click on it and click next, next, next

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and finally the Docker will be installed inside your system.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If you have any challenges in installing the Docker inside your system, you can click on this Get Started,

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
post that there is also clear instructions like learn how to install Docker for example

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm just clicking on this.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Learn how to install Docker, which will take me to the documentation website of Docker.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Here,

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
there are clear instructions given based upon the operating system.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So if you see install Docker desktop on Mac Windows Linux, if I click on this Windows, it is going

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
to show you all the installation steps that you need to follow, but please make sure you are having

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
at least four GB system Ram along with 64 bit processor.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So by seeing all these steps you should be able to install Docker inside your system.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If you are facing any issues, don't worry, there is also a troubleshoot link available.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Under this troubleshoot you'll be able to see the most common issues that you may face with Docker or

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Docker installation.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So please follow these

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
otherwise you can also post a question to me or you can also take help from the Docker community.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You can check there is a lot of help available from the Docker community inside the websites like StackOverflow,

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Docker community, so there is enough help for you to resolve any Docker issues.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So don't get demotivated.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The installation is going to be super, super easy. So once the installation is completed, you can

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
click on the sign in button which will take you to the website called hub.docker.com.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So since I already created an account, it is already logged in me, so easy bites is my account or

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,000
username.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
If you don't have an account, please make sure you are also creating an account and your account should

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
have an username and it will have password.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
There is no need of providing any credit card details, so once the account is created you can log in

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
into the Docker hub.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So this is the website which is hub.docker.com.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So please remember your username.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
In my case, the username of my Docker website is eazybytes.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We need to use the same inside the coming lectures.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So like I said, Docker Hub is a place where you can find that Docker images or you can also store your

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
own Docker images with the public access and private access.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
If you want to store the Docker images with the private access, then definitely you need to upgrade

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,000
your plan.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So if I click on this upgrade, you can see it will show you all the plans available.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
As of now, I'm using this personal plan which costs me $0.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So with this I can store Docker images in unlimited public repositories. For this course,

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
we are good with this personal plan, but in real projects, since we want to store our Docker images

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
in a secured manner, usually inside your organization they will provide a Docker login from any of

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
these plans.

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Mostly business plan.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But don't worry, for now you can happily use this personal plan.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So let me go back with this personal plan,

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I can only store my Docker images inside public repository.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's fine for me because my intention also to store all my Docker images inside a public repository

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
so that you can also access them.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We can create a new repository, but we'll see that later.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But for now, I just wanted to show you like you can see many products, they store their official images

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
inside this Docker hub.

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Only you can see Python has their own Docker image.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Postgres, ubuntu, MySQL.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
See they have 1 billion downloads from this Docker hub which shows how many developers are using this

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,000
docker.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So that's why it is very important for us to learn this docker.

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
For now, let me try to search a Docker image with the name MySQL.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So if you try to MySQL Docker image, you can see this is the MySQL

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Docker image.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
There is also a tag docker official image 1 billion times download happen.

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So in order to get this Docker image inside your local system, you just need to run this command which

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
is Docker pull MySQL will deep dive into all those commands, don't worry.

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But for now I just wanted to show you that, inside this Docker hub we can store our own Docker images

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and at the same time we can also find and fetch all the Docker images of other products that we want

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
to use.

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
If you want to use a database or if you want to use a server or if you want to use a language.

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So all of them are available as a docker

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Images inside this Docker hub.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Once you install the Docker and created this Docker account, you need to click on this Docker icon

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
available inside your local system.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
As of now you can see I have already logged in so I can click on this dashboard.

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So this is my Docker dashboard where you can see all my local Docker images, Docker containers,

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Docker volumes, will be using this Docker desktop a lot, but please make sure if you are not logged

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
in already, you can click on this button at the top right corner where you can enter your credentials.

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
With that,

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:16,000
your local docker is connected to the Docker hub repository that you have created with the same username,

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
which in my case this is eazybytes.

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And you can also confirm the Docker installation is completed successfully or not by running a command

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
inside the terminal.

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So here inside my terminal I'm running a command which is docker  version.

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You'll be getting the version details about the client and the server.

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The client is using the operating system, which is Darwin, whereas the server, like we discussed

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
it, is using the Linux.

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So inside my Mac operating system, whenever I try to install this Docker internally, it is going to

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
create a small and lightweight Linux virtual machine.

107
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And inside that Linux virtual machine, the Docker server is going to be installed.

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We already discussed about this.

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I hope this is clear and I'm also assuming your Docker installation is successful. For some reason,

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
if you face any issues, please check the existing Q&A questions or you can also try to get the help

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
from the web. If nothing is working,

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
if you are stuck, please let me know and post your question inside the Udemy Q&A.

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I should be able to help you.

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Thank you and I'll catch you in the next lecture bye.
