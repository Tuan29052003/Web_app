00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now, inside this lecture, let me give you a quick introduction about the development principles or

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
the standards that we need to follow while building cloud native applications.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Many of us who is trying to build cloud native applications or microservices will have a basic question,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
which is how to get succeeded in building a better cloud native application or a better microservices

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
applications.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Are there any guiding principles that can be considered for the same?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
To answer your question, yes, we do have standards, so let's try to understand them.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Back in 2012, the engineering team at Heroku Cloud Platform, they introduced 12 factor methodology.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So these are the 12 different development principles that are aimed at guiding the developers in designing

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and developing cloud native applications.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
These 12 different principles under the 12 factor methodology are the result of the Heroku team expertise

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
from many, many years building these cloud native applications.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
When you follow these 12 factor methodology, your applications will have advantages like ready for

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
cloud platform deployment regardless of whatever cloud platform that you choose.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You can seamlessly deploy your cloud native applications. And at the core of this cloud native applications,

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
they are going to support scalability and elasticity.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And very similarly, these cloud native systems that you are going to develop with the help of 12 factor

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
methodology, they allow system portability, which means your applications can run across different

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
systems and environments without any issues.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And at last these applications will support continuous deployment and agility.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So in the initial days, everyone are recommended to follow these 12 factor methodology.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But later on, after few years since the technology is getting evolved day by day, a person with the

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
name Kevin Hoffman, he expanded these 12 factor methodology by adding three more principles.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And in his book with the name Beyond the 12 Factory app, he revised all these 12 factor methodology.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And on top of that, he also introduced three more development principles.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And with that, a new 15 factor methodology came into picture.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And this is the most latest one right now everyone is referring to.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So do you want to see what are these principles?

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let's try to see the summary of these methodologies.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So these are the 15 methodologies are the principles or guidelines that any developer or organization

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
should follow while building cloud native applications.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Without following these standards, they can't tell their applications as cloud native applications

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
because they will end up with some problems since they are not following these standards.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
These standards are built based upon the development experience of cloud native applications.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If you see first, this is the website like everyone used to refer 12factor.net

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So inside this website you can read all the 12 factor methodologies and if you can scroll down here,

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
these are the 12 factors.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If you can click on each of them, there is a detailed description about each of these methodologies.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So don't worry, I'm going to explain them inside this course.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You don't need to read all of them and digest them.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm going to explain them in an easily understandable format.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But like I said, these Twelve-Factor app is right now outdated.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Like I said, Kevin Hoffman, he wrote a book with the name Beyond the Twelve-Factor App.

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And inside this book he added three more principles or guidelines.

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And with that this became 15 factor methodology.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You can see the description of this book.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
In 2012, Early cloud pioneer Heroku developed the 12 Factor app, a set of rules and guidelines for

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
helping organizations for building cloud native applications.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It served as an excellent starting point, but as a technology changes day by day, some areas need

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
revisiting to accommodate the current best practices

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
this practical book expands on the original guidelines to help you to build applications that not only

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
function in the cloud but also thrive.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I hope you are clear.

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Like what is the difference between 12 Factor app and the 15 factor app methodology?

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So 15 factor methodology is the most updated one.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
If you attend an interview focusing on microservices, definitely there will be some questions around

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
these 12 factor methodology or 15 factor methodology.

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's why it is very important to understand these methodologies one by one.

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So let's try to deep dive into these methodologies and learn quickly about them.

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Thank you and I'll catch you in the next lecture bye.
