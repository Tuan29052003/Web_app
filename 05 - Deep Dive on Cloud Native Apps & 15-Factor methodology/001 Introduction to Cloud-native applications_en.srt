00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Welcome back to the new section.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This section is a small theory section where we are going to discuss about the definition of cloud native

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
applications.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What are the characters of Cloud Native applications and 12 factor methodology and 15 factor methodology?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
These are the standards that any microservice developer has to know because by following these standards

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
only we are going to build many concepts inside the microservice in the upcoming sections.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So we are into a new section and the slides color is also changed to a new color.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I will be using various colors for my power point slides background in different different sections.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The purpose of this is to make sure you're not getting bored by looking at the same color of the slide

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and at the same time it is going to please your eyes because you are seeing different, different colors

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
in different sections and you won't get bored or you won't feel mundane.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Now coming to the question, what is a cloud native application?

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You might be hearing this jargon or this buzzword a lot inside your project or inside some blogs or

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
podcasts or YouTube videos.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So let's try to understand what are these cloud native applications and how they are related to the

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
microservices.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
First, I'll try to provide a layman language.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Like any non-technical person can understand this definitions. Cloud Native applications are the software

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
applications that are designed and developed specifically to leverage the cloud computing principles

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and take the full advantage of cloud native technologies and services, which means these applications

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
are built and optimized to run inside any cloud environments by utilizing the cloud advantages like

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
scalability, elasticity and flexibility.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
In simple words, cloud native applications are built for cloud environments so that the organizations

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
can take complete advantage of cloud provider services and technologies.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Now let's try to understand the official definition of cloud native applications from the Cloud Native

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Computing Foundation.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So if you see here, cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
in modern dynamic environments such as public, private and hybrid clouds.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So the cloud environment can be anything, it can be it can be your own data center, it can be GCP,

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
azure, or it can be a hybrid combination of private cloud and public cloud.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Regardless of what type of cloud computing you're trying to use, your cloud native applications will

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,000
work.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So how this is possible is when we are trying to build cloud native applications, we will try to leverage

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
technologies like containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure and declarative

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
APIs.

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So all these technologies make your applications to run on any cloud so you won't get vendor lock in

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
with any particular cloud environment.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
On top of these cloud advantages.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
These techniques also enable developing loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable and

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
observable.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Resilient means they can withstand any failures manageable

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
you already know they are easy to manage and observable means we'll get to know everything about our

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
applications, how it is working,

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
are there any issues?

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
There is also a separate section inside this course about the observability.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We'll be discussing more details in that section.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So with all these new techniques, along with the robust automation, these cloud native applications,

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
they allow engineers to develop high impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So this will give freedom to the organizations and the developers if they want to make a small change

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
or if they want to make a small enhancement, they can do that very quickly without any defects or regression

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
issues being introduced. Because they are all loosely coupled and it is very easy to test them to develop

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
new enhancements.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I hope this is clear to you.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So if anyone asks you what is the definition of cloud native application inside an interview or inside

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
any project, first try to understand whether the opposite person who is asking is a technical person

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
or a non-technical person.

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
If he is a non-technical person, please share this layman definition.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Whereas if the person is a technical person, you can share the official definition from the Cloud Native

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Computing Foundation.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I hope you are clear about the definition of cloud native applications.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll be discussing in the coming lectures how these cloud native applications are related to the microservices.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Thank you and I'll catch you in the next lecture bye.
