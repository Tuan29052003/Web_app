00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Right now we are clear about the definition of cloud native applications. inside this lecture,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
let me explain you about the important characteristics of cloud native applications.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So whenever you see these characters for any application, then you can easily assume they are cloud

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
native applications.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The very first main character of Cloud Native application is microservice.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
When you are building microservice based applications, which are like loosely coupled and smaller in

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
nature, then that gives a flexibility to you to develop them parallelly and deploy and scale independently.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So this is the main advantage of the cloud native applications.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So cloud native application is a broader topic and under that topic microservices is one of the important

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
feature.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
After building microservices like separating your business logic, you will obviously containerize your

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
applications with the help of Docker or any other containerization software.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So what are these containers we already discussed?

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
These are typically packaged and deployed using Docker containers.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
These containers provide a lightweight and consistent environment for running applications and making

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
them highly portable across different cloud platforms and infrastructure.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
With the help of these containers, only the code will work very similarly regardless of which cloud

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
environment you are trying to deploy. You take this container, you try to deploy inside your local

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
system and you deploy inside the AWS, GCP, Azure Cloud in all the places it is going to work in very

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
similar manner.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Whereas this is not the scenario with a monolithic application.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Your monolithic application won't give such kind of flexibility.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You need to put a lot of efforts to bring that consistency across all the cloud platforms.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The next character of cloud native applications is they provide scalability and elasticity.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Since you are building your applications based upon microservices and with the help of containers,

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
they can be easily scaled horizontally allowing them to handle any kind of traffic that comes towards

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
your applications.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So adding more instances of services is going to be super easy and this can be achieved automatically

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
with the help of container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We also have separate section inside this course where I'll be showing you how automatically scale your

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
microservice applications with the help of Kubernetes.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Moving on to the next principle, these cloud native applications, they follow DevOps practices, by

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
embracing all these DevOps principles.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
They promote a collaboration culture between the development and operations teams.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Whenever these cloud native applications are being built, they will not be any blame game between the

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
developers and operations team when they are building cloud native application because they are following

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
these DevOps practices and with the help of these DevOps practices, they will incorporate continuous

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
integration, continuous delivery and automated deployment pipelines to streamline the software development

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and deployment process.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So these cloud native applications, they will give complete flexibility to the organizations, whether

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
they want to do continuous integration only or whether they want to go with the continuous delivery

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
or if they want to go with the continuous deployment as well.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The next character of native applications is, they are resilient and fault tolerance in nature.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Whatever applications that we are going to develop with the help of cloud native principles, they can

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
withstand any kind of failures which will make them resilient and they will utilize techniques such

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
as distributed architecture, load balancing and automated fail recovery to ensure high availability

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and fault tolerance.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
One example that I can give here is, think like you have a microservice by following the cloud native

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
application principles, you will deploy this microservice in multiple locations.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Even if one of the location has a downtime due to some power outage or due to some internet issue,

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
the microservice will continue to work from the other location that you have deployed.

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And at the same time, for some reason, if one of your microservice instance is not working platforms

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
like Kubernetes, they can automatically shut down that microservice instance and bring up a new instance.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This way you are ensuring the failure recovery automatically and bringing fault tolerance inside your

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
applications.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Moving on to the next character of cloud Native applications, which is they utilize cloud native services

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
to a great extent.

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Like I said, cloud native applications means they are developed to leverage the cloud environments

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
to a great extent.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
When an organization or an application uses these cloud native services provided they don't have to

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
focus on infrastructure because all these services will be monitored and maintained by the cloud platform

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
provider itself.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
With that, the developers and the organizations they

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
can simply focus more on the application logic and enhancing the business logic with a very less

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
focus on the infrastructure components.

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Like you can see these are all the important characters of cloud native applications. Inside this course,

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
we are going to touch all of these characters in the various sections.

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Whenever you see a application is following all these characters, then you can simply assume that is

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
an cloud native application.

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I hope this is clear.

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Thank you and I'll catch you in the next lecture bye.
