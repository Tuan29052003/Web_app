00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now inside this lecture, let me try to spend a few minutes explaining you about the differences between

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
cloud native applications and traditional apps.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The very first difference of cloud native application and traditional applications is, cloud

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
native applications will have predictable behavior, whereas with traditional applications, the behavior

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
is going to be unpredictable.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
For example, inside microservice environment, if there is an issue, we can easily track that where

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
the issue is because all your business logic is loosely coupled and separated into multiple microservices,

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
so you can easily predict where the exception happens.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Whereas inside monolithic application, since all your business logic clubbed together, you never know

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
where the exception happens until your developer put a lot of efforts by debugging all the lines of

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
code that you have inside your application.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The next difference that we have here is cloud native applications

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
they are not OS dependent.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
They will abstract the operating system, whereas traditional enterprise applications, they are dependent

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
on operating system.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This is because inside cloud native applications we are going to adopt docker containers and Docker

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
images where they will abstract the operating system and they will work in any operating system.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The next difference that we have here is, cloud native applications

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
they are rightly sized and they are following the right capacity and they work in an independent manner.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Whereas with traditional applications they are oversized capacity because you have all your business

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
logic inside a single application or inside a single codebase.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's why most of the times traditional enterprise applications, they are dependent on each other.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Moving on to the next difference cloud native applications

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
they support continuous delivery with the help of DevOps principles and automation, whereas traditional

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
enterprise applications, they follow waterfall development.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
They won't support Agile style of working inside any organization.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Then the last difference that we have here is Cloud

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Native Application supports rapid recovery and automated scalability. Inside cloud native applications

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
if one of the microservice instance is not working properly Kubernetes, they can automatically create

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
a new instance and try to recover automatically and also scale your applications automatically based

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
upon the incoming traffic.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Whereas with traditional applications, since they are not going to use Docker containers, obviously

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
they cannot rely on the platforms like Kubernetes with that reasons

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
with the traditional enterprise applications, the recovery is going to be super slow and at the same

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
time there won't be any automated style of recovery and scalability. From these differences

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It is very clear that Cloud Native application is a clear winner compared to the traditional enterprise

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
applications.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So now you agree that cloud native applications are good and that's why we are trying to learn and build

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
microservices inside this course.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But here you may have a question like do we have any principles or guidelines that we need to follow

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
while building these cloud native applications in order to get all these advantages?

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Off course, there are good guidelines and principles that we can follow while building these cloud native

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
applications or microservices.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So let's try to understand what are these principles and guidelines from the next lecture.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Thank you and I'll catch you in the next lecture bye.
