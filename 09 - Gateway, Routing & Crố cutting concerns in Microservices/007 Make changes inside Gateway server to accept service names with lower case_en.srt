00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
As of now, we are trying to send the request to the Gateway server by using the application name in

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
complete capital letters like you can see accounts, loans and cards.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If I try to send in a small case letter, it is not going to work.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I can show you the demo as well.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Here I'm going to change this accounts from capital letters to small letters post that I will try to invoke

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,000
these API.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So let me click on the send button.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You can see I'm getting an error, which is 404 not found.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If you are fine using completely capital letters, you should be good with the default behavior of the

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
gateway server.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But mentioning a value inside the path in complete capital letters is very odd.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Even we can't request our client applications to send only the application name or the microservice

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
name in capital letters.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That will be a very weird ask or weird behavior inside our application.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So to overcome this, we can introduce a new property inside the application.yml Gateway server.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So let me go to the IntelliJ idea.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Here inside my IntelliJ idea, I need to create a new property under this locator just in the same place

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
where we have enabled, in the same place

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm going to mention a new property which is lowercase service ID.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
With this, the property is going to be spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
lowercase serviceId to this property

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to mention the value as true.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
With this we are telling to our gateway server.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Please accept the service name with the completely lowercase.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So now I have made this changes

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
let me do a build.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Once the build is completed, we can try to validate the same inside the postman.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This time you can see we have completely small letters inside the service name or inside the application

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,000
name.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So let me click on the send button and you can see I'm getting a successful response.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Very similarly, we can also try to test the fetch API for the same

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
we need to take the mobile number and go to the other request and mention the same mobile number here.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
First, let me check with completely capital letters.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So if I try to click on the send button, you can see now this time I'm getting a not found error,

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
so I'm going to make this as completely small letters. With this

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
If I try to send the response, you will get a successful response.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm going to continue this way only because this looks very professional to me.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And ideally we should never use complete capital letters inside a URL path.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I hope you are clear about this small change that we have done.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Thank you and I'll catch you in the next lecture bye.
