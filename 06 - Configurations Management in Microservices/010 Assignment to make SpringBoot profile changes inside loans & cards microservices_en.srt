1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
As of now, we have updated the accounts microservice with the concepts like spring boot profiles and

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
we have introduced many properties inside the application.yml file and we read the same properties

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
by three different REST APIs inside accounts microservice.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now I'm going to give you an assignment.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Are you ready for the assignment?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The assignment is you need to make very similar changes inside cards and loans microservice.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And this is going to be super, super easy.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If you have questions like what is the property name,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
what is the property values that I have to use, please refer the code present inside the GitHub repo.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If you see inside the GitHub repo eazybytes/microservice project.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Under this repo there is a section six and inside this I have uploaded the folder which is

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
v1-springboot.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Under this version one spring boot folder, we have three different microservices accounts we already

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
completed.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you have any questions around cards, what type of properties we have to use, like I said, please

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
use the same properties like we created for accounts microservice, but try to give different phone

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
numbers, different contact details and different message.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So you can also get those details by going into this GitHub repo and look at the application.yml file.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And if you have any questions you can always refer to the code present inside this GitHub repo

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and complete the assignment.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
My sincere request is to complete this assignment so that you are getting enough

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
hands-On.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm trying to explain with one microservice and if you do the similar changes inside the two microservice,

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
that is going to bring lot of practice for you and these concepts will be entered into your subconscious

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
memory.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So even if someone is trying to take an interview by waking you up in the midnight, you will be able

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
to answer all the questions because you are doing lot of practice inside this course.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So please put an effort here and try to implement the changes inside the other microservices.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
If you faced with some issues, don't get demotivated.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Anyway, I'm going to cover the code changes inside the cards and loans microservice very quickly inside

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
the next lecture.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I hope you will be successful at this assignment.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Thank you and I'll catch you in the next lecture bye.
