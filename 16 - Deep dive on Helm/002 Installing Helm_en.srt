1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
To get started with the helm,

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
first, we need to make sure we install this helm inside our local system.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So to install this helm, we need to go to the website of Helm, which is helm.sh.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Inside this website in the top right corner, we have a button with the name Get started.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So please click on that post that you will be landed onto this page.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Inside this page,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
first, try to read what are the prerequisites to get started with the helm.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The very first prerequisite is you should have a proper Kubernetes cluster running inside your local

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
system or inside any cloud environment. And post that,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
we should also decide about security configurations which are related to our installation.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So this is an optional pre request.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's why you can see here the highlighted if any.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So we don't need to worry about the second pre request.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The third pre request is we need to install and configure helm inside our local system.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So to install helm we can click on these installing helm option and this will take me to the installing

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
helm web page.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Inside this page we have many options on how to install right from binary releases from scripts.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But my favorite option and my recommendation is to follow to install helm with the help of package managers.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So here it's very funny.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We are going to install a package manager which is helm with the help of other package manager.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So since I'm using Mac OS, I'm going to use Homebrew.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So this is the default package manager inside Mac OS.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So the command that we need to run here is, brew install helm.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So let me try to run this command and post that we can see what is happening.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'll also show you the steps that you need to follow if you are using Windows in few seconds.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So inside my terminal I can run this command, which is brew install helm.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So with this I'm telling to my homebrew to install helm related package manager since I already installed

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
inside my local system.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It is trying to get the latest installation of helm into my local system.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,000
At last

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
like you can see, I got an output saying that the installation is completed. So you can also verify

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
if the installation is completed or not by running the command, which is helm version.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So this will give you an output on which version I'm using.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You can see as of now I'm using helm 3.2.3 version.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So with this now my helm installation is completed inside my local system.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
As a next step, let me show you very quickly how to install Helm inside the Windows operating system.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So for Windows Operating System, you can use one of the famous package manager, which is chocolatey.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So first you need to make sure chocolatey is installed inside your system post that only you can install

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,000
helm.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So to install chocolatey it is going to be super easy.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You need to go to the chocolatey website.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Inside the Chocolatey website there is an option install on the top right corner.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So let me click on that .

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Here there are steps on how we can install this chocolatey package manager.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So this is a famous package manager for Windows Operating System.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So if you can scroll down on this page, please select the individual option because we are trying to

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
set up in our own local system.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Once you select this individual option, we need to make sure we are opening the PowerShell inside the

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Windows operating system with admin rights.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So please go to your Windows search box and look for PowerShell and right click on that and open as

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,000
an admin.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So once you open the PowerShell as an admin, you need to run the command, which is get execution policy.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So once you run this command you will get an output, whether it is all signed or whether it is restricted.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
For some reason, if you are getting output as restricted, that means you cannot install any other

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
softwares with the help of PowerShell.

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So to disable these restricted nature we can run a command which is set execution policy all signed.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So once we execute these set execution policy all sign post that you can try to run again this get

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
execution policy and you should get an output which is all signed instead of restricted.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
After that, it's going to be super easy.

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You just need to copy this command.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Like you can see here, this entire command you need to execute inside your PowerShell and this will

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
install chocolaty package manager and you can also verify whether the installation of chocolate is successful

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
or not by simply typing choco or choco space hyphen question mark.

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And that will give the output saying that which version of chocolatey is installed.

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So once the chocolatey is installed inside your local system, you can go to the helm and here there

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
is an command that you need to run to install helm with the help of chocolatey.

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So the command is choco install Kubernetes - helm.

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
As soon as you execute this command helm is going to be installed inside your local

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
system.

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And you can also confirm that by running a command, which is hell version.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I hope this is clear.

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If you are using some other operating system like Ubuntu or Linux.

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
There are other approaches also mentioned inside this web page.

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I recommend you looking at these web page if you have any questions around the helm installation.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I hope you are successful at installing the helm inside your local system.

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If not, please take help from this web page and if you still not able to install helm, please shoot

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
